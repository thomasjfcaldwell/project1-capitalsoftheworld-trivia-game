## Project name - Capitals Of The World Learning Trivia Game

### Project Description

This project will be called Capitals Of The World, it will be a single learner game and used mainly as a educational tool but will be fun to use.
The player will be asked at random from 200 questions, 20 questions per game, the questions will be asked in a multiple choice format. There will be 4 choices with 1 of the 4 being the correct answer. The amount of questions the learner has answered correctly will be visible, also if a learner answers a question incorrectly they will be given the correct answer before moving on to the next question. The game will end after the 20 questions have been asked and the learner will be informed if they passed or not. The learner will need to get at least a score of 80% to pass. If the learner has failed they will see an encouraging message to try again, if the learner has passed they will be encouraged to beat there score.
